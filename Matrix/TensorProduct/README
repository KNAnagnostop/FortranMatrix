 use tensorprod_mod

 Z = tensorprod(X,Y)          X,Y ,Z complex or real arrays with 2 indices
 Z = tensorprod(X1,X2,...,X6) Z,Xi,  complex or real arrays with 2 indices
 Z = tensorprod(u,v)          u,v ,  complex or real arrays with 1 index

 Z = vec2col(v)               Z(:,1) = v
 Z = vec2row(u)               Z(1,:) = u

 Z = tensorprod(vec2col(v),X) tensor products with vectors
 Z = tensorprod(vec2row(v),X) tensor products with vectors
 Z = tensorprod(X,vec2col(v)) tensor products with vectors
 Z = tensorprod(X,vec2row(v)) tensor products with vectors

 u = vectorize(Z)             construct column vector u from columns of Z stacking them on top of each other
